Pokemon, which is short for "pocket monster," has become a phenomenal success in world among children. There are cartoons and even a movie based on the Pokemon characters. In that imaginary world, Pokemon are the creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokemon universe. The Pokedex is an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokemon featured in the Pokemon video game, anime and manga series. In this mini project, you are going to develop a Pokedex, which you will collect data by crawling, and transfer simple information about Pokemon to the user.
