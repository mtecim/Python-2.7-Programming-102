All types of foods and drinks have certain amount of calories that affect our diets. For those people
who want to keep a healthy lifestyle and so watch out what food they consume, they may have some
difficulties in counting the calories in each dish or drink they are having. To serve for such a
purpose, you are going to develop a software tool which keeps track of calories of the foods and
drinks chosen by the user based on a specified calorie amount.
