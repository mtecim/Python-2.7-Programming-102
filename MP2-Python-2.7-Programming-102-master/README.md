#Python 2.7 Project for Benginners.

To get a moment away from the courses and exams, we hang out somewhere to relax alone or together with our friends. Sometimes we would like to discover new places, try new tastes or watch the landscapes we haven't seen before. We can explore these new places through the recommendations of our friends. In this mini project, you are going to develop a recommendation engine that will help you to choose a new place to hang out by the ratings of other users.
